Abstract:

RealOffice is an application software designed for use in the CSE department office to simplify routine procedural tasks. In essence, it allows office staff to schedule different kinds of meetings, track meeting requirements, manage room allotments, file meeting reports and cancel arrangements for cancelled meetings. It also reminds the staff regarding upcoming events that need attention. The protocols used by the CSE department office can be adapted to a digitized workflow. This document proceeds to build the requirements for such a system, highlighting the current workflow and possibilities for the upcoming software project.
